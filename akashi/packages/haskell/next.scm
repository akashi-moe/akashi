     "Pure Haskell implementation of SplitMix described in .  Guy L. Steele, Jr., Doug
Lea, and Christine H. Flood.  2014.  Fast splittable pseudorandom number
generators.  In Proceedings of the 2014 ACM International Conference on Object
Oriented Programming Systems Languages & Applications (OOPSLA 14).  ACM, New
York, NY, USA, 453-472.  DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1145/2660193.2660195> .  The
paper describes a new algorithm /SplitMix/ for /splittable/ pseudorandom number
generator that is quite fast: 9 64 bit arithmetic/logical operations per 64 bits
generated. . /SplitMix/ is tested with two standard statistical test suites
(DieHarder and TestU01, this implementation only using the former) and it
appears to be adequate for \"everyday\" use, such as Monte Carlo algorithms and
randomized data structures where speed is important. .  In particular, it
__should not be used for cryptographic or security applications__, because
generated sequences of pseudorandom values are too predictable (the mixing
functions are easily inverted, and two successive outputs suffice to reconstruct
the internal state).")

pseudo-random number interface .  In pure code, use System.Random.uniform and
System.Random.uniformR from \"System.Random\" to generate pseudo-random numbers
with a pure pseudo-random number generator like System.Random.StdGen'. .  As an
example, here is how you can simulate rolls of a six-sided die using
System.Random.uniformR': . >>> let roll = uniformR (1, 6) :: RandomGen g => g ->
(Word, g) >>> let rolls = unfoldr (Just .  roll) :: RandomGen g => g -> [Word]
>>> let pureGen = mkStdGen 42 >>> take 10 (rolls pureGen) :: [Word]
[1,1,3,2,4,5,3,4,6,2] .  See \"System.Random\" for more details. . ==
\"System.Random.Stateful\": monadic pseudo-random number interface .  In monadic
code, use System.Random.Stateful.uniformM and System.Random.Stateful.uniformRM
from \"System.Random.Stateful\" to generate pseudo-random numbers with a monadic
pseudo-random number generator, or using a monadic adapter. .  As an example,
here is how you can simulate rolls of a six-sided die using
System.Random.Stateful.uniformRM': . >>> let rollM = uniformRM (1, 6) ::
StatefulGen g m => g -> m Word >>> let pureGen = mkStdGen 42 >>> runStateGen_
pureGen (replicateM 10 .  rollM) :: [Word] [1,1,3,2,4,5,3,4,6,2] .  The monadic
adapter System.Random.Stateful.runStateGen_ is used here to lift the pure
pseudo-random number generator @@pureGen@@ into the
System.Random.Stateful.StatefulGen context. .  The monadic interface can also be
used with existing monadic pseudo-random number generators.  In this example, we
use the one provided in the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mwc-random
mwc-random> package: . >>> import System.Random.MWC as MWC >>> let rollM =
uniformRM (1, 6) :: StatefulGen g m => g -> m Word >>> monadicGen <- MWC.create

     "QuickCheck is a library for random testing of program properties.  The
programmer provides a specification of the program, in the form of properties
which functions should satisfy, and QuickCheck then tests that the properties
hold in a large number of randomly generated cases.  Specifications are
expressed in Haskell, using combinators provided by QuickCheck.  QuickCheck
provides combinators to define properties, observe the distribution of test
data, and define test data generators. .  Most of QuickCheck's functionality is
exported by the main \"Test.QuickCheck\" module.  The main exception is the
monadic property testing library in \"Test.QuickCheck.Monadic\". .  If you are new
to QuickCheck, you can try looking at the following resources: . * The
<http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/manual.html official QuickCheck
manual>.  It's a bit out-of-date in some details and doesn't cover newer
QuickCheck features, but is still full of good advice. *

tutorial written by a user of QuickCheck. .  The

example.  The homepage contains links to a user manual, an academic paper and
further information: <https://shakebuild.com> .  To use Shake the user writes a
Haskell program that imports \"Development.Shake\", defines some build rules, and
calls the Development.Shake.shakeArgs function.  Thanks to do notation and infix
operators, a simple Shake build system is not too dissimilar from a simple
Makefile.  However, as build systems get more complex, Shake is able to take
advantage of the excellent abstraction facilities offered by Haskell and easily
support much larger projects.  The Shake library provides all the standard
features available in other build systems, including automatic parallelism and
minimal rebuilds.  Shake also provides more accurate dependency tracking,
including seamless support for generated files, and dependencies on system
information (e.g. compiler version).")

remains valid even if structures are shared. . /Security/ .  This package
currently provides no defenses against hash collision attacks such as HashDoS.

@@Data.Map@@ or @@Data.Set@@ from the @@containers@@ package instead.")
